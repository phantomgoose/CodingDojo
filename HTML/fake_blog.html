            <h1>Why is it so hard to find good music on Spotify and similar sites?</h1>

            <p>It turns out, people have very different tastes when it comes to music and generating recommendations requires a huge amount of information about the individual's preferences as well as the songs themselves. Obtaining a user's preferences requires:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Their full cooperation, and</li>
            <li>A good deal of time investment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>While processing and classifying music is difficult to do programmatically.</p>

            <p>Let's consider the following:</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Roses</th>
                        <th>Violets</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>are</td>
                        <td>are</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>red</td>
                        <td>blue</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Also, I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some, people out there in our nation don't have maps, and, uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as and I believe that they should, our education over here in the US should help the US, uh, or, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future for our children.</p>
